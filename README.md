Spreadsheets.IkeaGlassBoard
===========================

This is an Excel spreadsheet that can be used to design special-purpose whiteboards based on the Ikea [KLUDD](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10114874/) product.

Each cell represents a 0.5 square centimeter.  The black cells represent the circular knobs used to mount the board.  Place colored cells around the center of the spreadsheet to represent where you'd like your colored tape to go.  You should put the tape on the non-writing side of the notice board.  I prefer 1/2cm or 1/4" colored art tape.  You can find this at Office Max or any art supply store.

## Template
You can use this template to design other special-purpose white boards.  Just copy the sheet and rename it.

## Calendar
Use this layout for a nice monthly calendar.  There are spaces here for Brother P-Touch labels for the day of the week column headers.

## Today
Use this layout as a daily scheduler, where you can place up to 10 working hours worth of your day.  In my personal Today board, I used lighter colored tape on the 30 minute dividers.

## Scrum Board
If you participate in Scrum, you can use this board to document your Code Freeze date, Release date, Build Versions, your JIRA Story numbers.  The area on the right gives you visibility of how many days are remaining in the sprint.

## Template (Portrait)
You can also use the Portrait version of the Template if you wish to mount your whiteboard vertically.
